# EduMatch

## Project Description
This is a mini project that is built ground up to showcase different screens of an application. I utilized the mobile first design approach where I simply design the layout from smaller screens (mobile) to larger screens. Common components are abstracted out for reusability. 

| Folder  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| /components  | Contains the common components that will be used across different pages  |
| /pages  | Contains the routes for the different pages   |
